# SOCI 101H - Week 1 Notes

## Lecture

#### Group Behavior

- Granovetter explained how our individual behavior can be influenced by the actions of others
- Behavior of authorities also influences our behavior

#### What is Sociology?

- The study of how societies are organized and how that organization affects the behavior of the people who live in them.
- Overlaps with economics, psychology, anthropology, and political science.
	- Sociologists study markets, small group behavior, attitudes, voting behavior, customs and traditions.

#### Why Study Sociology?

- Studying sociology can provide people with this wide knowledge and skills, including:
	- an understanding of social systems and large bureaucracies;
	- the ability to devise and carry out research projects to assess whether a program or policy is working;
	- the ability to collect, read, and analyze statistical information from polls or surveys;
	- the ability to recognize important differences in people's social, cultural, and economic backgrounds;
	- skills in preparing reports and communicating complex ideas; and
	- the capacity for critical thinking about social issues and problems that confront modern society
- Sociology helps us understand ourselves.
	- Sociological perspectives help us interpret our own experiences, our background and circumstances, and things that occur in our lives
	- You may find commonality with groups and communities discussed in the course, and may learn more about your own background, the country, and the people in your lives

#### Sociological Imagination

- A unique way of looking at the world
	- C. Wright Mills said we should look at the intersection of our personal stories with the larger social context
	- Our names show how our personal story is influenced by social forces
		- Legal limits on what we can name a child
		- Social expectations
			- Pressures to name children after ancestors
			- Negative reactions to certain names

#### A New Science for a Changing World

- Sociology emerged in the 1800s. The social context:
	- Industrial Revolution
	- Rapid movement to cities

#### Life in Cities

- People in cities are increasingly dependent on each other
	- Factory workers can't grow their own food or build their own house
	- Trade their wages for food, clothing, shelter, and other items
	- This specialization is the division of labor
		- Advantages = allows different groups to specialize in various tasks, becoming particularly good at them & creating a surplus to trade
		- Disadvantages = few options for those who don't have a desirable skill or product to offer others
- Cities were pretty terrible in the 1800s
	- Overcrowded housing
		- Frequent fires due to densely-built wooden buildings
		- No laws regulating wages, work hours, holidays, child labor, workplace safety, building codes for housing
		- Neighborhoods lack sanitation & sewage; lots of waste from people and livestock
		- Frequent disease outbreaks

#### Founders of Sociology

- Early sociologists were trying to explain the rapid changes they saw around them
	- And predict the consequences of those changes for society over time

#### Karl Marx

- Believed all societies throughout history were based on social conflict
	- Key to understanding a society was to look at the economic relationships in that society–how things are made and distributed
	- Groups with different resources and interests always struggle

#### Social Classes

- Two economic groups–or social classes–were key in an industrial capitalist society
	- Capitalists/Bourgeoisie: own factories
	- Workers/Proletariat: work for wages

#### Alienation

- Workers suffer from alienation
	- Little control over how they do their work
	- Little autonomy
	- From the product
	- From the means of production
	- From each other
	- From species being
	- From oneself

#### Emile Durkheim

- Wanted sociology to be a rigorous science
- Sociologists should focus on social facts
	- Things that exist outside the individual and put constraints on our behavior

#### Solidarity

- Durkheim emphasized solidarity: how people in a society are connected
	- Mechanical solidarity
	- Organic solidarity
- Key elements in society are integration and regulation

#### Max Weber

- The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1904)
- Unlike Marx and Durkheim, Weber said we need to look at individuals and the meanings they make of their behavior
	- Antipositivism: strive for subjectivity to represent social processes, cultural norms, and societal values.

#### Paradigms

- Three paradigms or perspectives dominate much of sociological discussions:
- **Structural functionalism**
- **Conflict theory**
- **Symbolic Interactionism**

- These perspectives are sometimes considered lenses to analyze many aspects of our society - such as government, religion, work, economics, race, class, and gender - are viewed through these three perspectives

## Key Terms

**antipositivism** - the view that social researchers should strive for subjectivity as they worked to represent social processes, cultural norms, and societal values

**conflict theory** - a theory that looks at society as a competition for limited resources

**constructivism** - an extension of symbolic interaction theory which proposes that reality is what humans cognitively construct it to be

**culture** - a group's shared practices, values, and beliefs

**dramaturgical analysis** - a technique sociologists use in which they view society through the metaphor of theatrical performance

**dynamic equilibrium** - a stable state in which all parts of a healthy society work together properly

**dysfunctions** - social patterns that have undesirable consequences for the operation of society

**figuration** - the process of simultaneously analyzing the behavior of an individual and the society that shapes that behavior

**function** - the part a recurrent activity plays in the social life as a whole and the contribution it makes to structural continuity

**functionalism** - a theoretical approach that sees society as a structure with interrelated parts designed to meet the biological and social needs of individuals that make up that society

**generalized others** - the organized and generalized attitude of a social group

**grand theories** - an attempt to explain large-scale relationships and answer fundamental questions such as why societies form and why they change

**hypothesis** - a testable proposition

**latent functions** - the unrecognized or unintended consequences of a social process

**macro-level** - a wide-scale view of the role of social structures within a society

**manifest functions** - sought consequences of a social process

**micro-level theories** - the study of specific relationships between individuals or small groups

**paradigms** - philosophical and theoretical frameworks used within a discipline to formulate theories, generalizations, and the experiments performed in support of them

**positivism** - the scientific study of social patterns

**qualitative sociology** - in-depth interviews, focus groups, and/or analysis of content sources as the source of its data

**quantitative sociology** - statistical methods such as surveys with large numbers of participants

**reification** - an error of treating an abstract concept as though it has a real, material existence

**significant others** - specific individuals that impact a person's life

**social facts** - the laws, morals, values, religious beliefs, customs, fashions, rituals, and all of the cultural rules that govern social life

**social institutions** - patterns of beliefs and behaviors focused on meeting social needs

**social solidarity** - the social ties that bind a group of people together such as kinship, shared location, and religion

**society** - a group of people who live in a defined geographical area who interact with one another and who share a common culture

**sociological imagination** - the ability to understand how your own past relates to that of other people, as well as to history in general and societal structures in particular

**sociology** - the systematic study of society and social interaction

**symbolic interactionism** - a theoretical perspective through which scholars examine the relationship of individuals within their society by studying their communication (language and symbols)

**theory** - a proposed explanation about social interactions or society
