**content analysis** - applying a systematic approach to record and value information gleaned from secondary data as it relates to the study at hand

**correlation** - when a change in one variable coincides with a change in another variable, but does not necessarily indicate causation

**debunking** - looking beyond the obvious to expose falseness by examining merit, logic, and evidence.

**dependent variables** - a variable changed by other variables

**empirical evidence** - evidence that comes from direct observations, scientifically gathered data, or experimentation

**ethnography** - participating and observing thinking and behavior in a social setting

**experiment** - the testing of a hypothesis under controlled conditions

**field research** - gathering data from a natural environment without doing a lab experiment or a survey

**Hawthorne effect** - when study subjects behave in a certain manner due to their awareness of being observed by a researcher

**hypothesis** - a testable educated guess about predicted outcomes between two or more variables

**independent variables** - variables that cause changes in dependent variables

**interpretive framework** - a sociological research approach that seeks in-depth understanding of a topic or subject through observation or interaction; this approach is not based on hypothesis testing

**interview** - a one-on-one conversation between the researcher and the subject

**literature review** - a scholarly research step that entails identifying and studying all existing studies on a topic to create a basis for new research

**nonreactive research** - using secondary data, does not include direct contact with research subjects and does not alter or influence people’s behaviors

**operational definitions** - specific explanations of abstract concepts that a researcher plans to study

**participant observation** - when a researcher immerses herself in a group or social setting in order to make observations from an “insider” perspective

**population** - a defined group serving as the subject of a study

**primary data** - data that are collected directly from firsthand experience

**qualitative data** - non-numerical, descriptive data that is often subjective and based on what is experienced in a natural setting

**quantitative data** - data collected in numerical form that can be counted and analyzed using statistics

**random sample** - a study’s participants being randomly selected to serve as a representation of a larger population

**reliability** - a measure of a study’s consistency that considers how likely results are to be replicated if a study is reproduced

**samples** - small, manageable number of subjects that represent the population

**scientific method** - an established scholarly research that involves asking a question, researching existing sources, forming a hypothesis, designing a data collection method, gathering data, and drawing conclusions

**secondary data analysis** - using data collected by others and applying new interpretations

**surveys** - collect data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about thinking, behaviors, and opinions, often in the form of a questionnaire

**validity** - the degree to which a sociological measure accurately reflects the topic of study
